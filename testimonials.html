            <p class="testimonial-text">Before Maddie's edits, I was struggling with a lot of my essays and feeling unconfident about the story that my application was conveying. After working with Maddie, for the first time, I felt like I had a plan to finish my application. The type of edits Maddie gives is honestly something you will never find anywhere else. Her edits not only tell you what's wrong with your current essay but give you specific plans to fix or write essays step by step. Her flexibility is really admirable. She was willing to call me and work long hours to help me get where I needed to be and worked with me to write amazing essays. Her edits not only include Google doc comments and bullet-pointed plans but also include video edits, which explain her thought process on how she viewed the current state of my essays and how I could improve it. She also provides examples for essay content which is an invaluable resource. Each time, Maddie's suggestions have taken my essays to the next level. I would highly recommend her to anyone who is applying to selective schools. Her edits will make your essays truly standout.</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">I would sum my experience with Madison in one word: awesome. I'm an international student with what I'd consider relatively low stats, and Maddie took my essays from good to perfect. She provided me with a boatload of extra material and was willing to go through my essays until I felt they were perfect. I've since been accepted to Duke University's Pratt school of engineering with Merit scholarship (with my low stats 💀), Pomona College and RIT. Getting into these schools are only a testimony of how Maddie improved my essays and helped me to find my authentic voice to tell a compelling story. I'd definitely recommend that you pay her $50 dollars per edit (jk jk🤣). But honestly, she's amazing, and it would be a wise decision to have her go through your essays with her critical eyes, because at this point, she's the holder of that 'secret sauce' colleges like.</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">I had Maddie edit three of my essays for my UMICH application and I am SO thankful to have found her. Maddie made so many edits on my essays making them top-notch and error-free. Some edits she made were things like word choice, tenses, sentence structure, overall structure, word count and so much more. Not only did she edit my essays, but she also created videos describing how to fix my essay and videos explaining how to write certain supplementals. This was very beneficial in many ways and gave me a good idea of what to fix and where to start. The advice she gave was great and I could tell she knows a lot about the application process and how to make your essay show who you are as a person. Maddie also helped me right up until the minute before my application was due, literally. I cannot thank her enough for all of her help and I can proudly say I am confident with my application solely because of my essays. Maddie is a very hard-worker and a pro at what she does!</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">What I loved the most about Madison's edits is how well she can improve word choice and weave in beautiful descriptive language. At the end of her edits, she writes several bullet points summarizing what she thought of the essay as a whole, whether the topic could be better, and how to think of a potentially better idea. I found these to be incredibly helpful. In addition to her meticulous edits, she's also highly responsive and professional. 100% would recommend it!</p>

I really don't think there's anything more to fix since you really addressed everything I tried to portray through my essays. Thanks for doing this essay marathon with me on the first day of 2021.

            <p class="testimonial-text">Maddie's essay edits are amazing. I got two of my 650-word essays edited by her and it truly impressed me when I read my essays after she polished them. Her word choice to improve my vocabulary in the essay was super cool because it captured my tone really well to picture my feelings in the reader's mind and even helped me cut down bulky sentences to fit for the 650-word count. If you guys don't know - Maddie is not someone who gives this service solely for money- when she decides to edit your essay she really means it to help you out of her heart: last December she sacrificed her free time during Christmas to help me out and edit my essays and it's definitely something that no other essay editing service provider would do unless they charge you like 10 times the amount. So guys, anyone out there who is searching for an excellent essay editor who would dive into your essay to edit it in the most spectacular way, I highly recommend you pick Maddie because she's that icon.</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">As an international student, I was completely unfamiliar with the US college application process at first and had no idea what colleges were looking for in an applicant. Thankfully, I chanced upon Maddie, and I'm so glad I did! She patiently guided me through the essay-writing process step-by-step, from formulating and organizing my ideas to adding descriptive imagery to better engage my reader. I loved that her feedback was at once honest, encouraging, and painstakingly detailed, pushing me to improve my essays with every new draft I wrote. She was also very timely and replied to emails within 24 hours, aiding me in coping with tight application deadlines. When our plans to discuss my essay over a call fell through due to time zone differences, she recorded a video reviewing my essay line by line and provided me with comprehensive essay advice she had compiled herself. Overall, I had an excellent experience–Maddie is so pleasant to work with, and I'd recommend her essay-editing services for anyone :)</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">Maddie was so kind and helped me through the stress of college admission. She edited my essay for sentence structure, rephrasing, and overall cohesion. She read through my essay several times and gave me lots of personal and helpful edits. I can tell she really cared about making my essay stronger and doing anything she could to help. She's very professional and kind and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for essay editing.</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">I asked Madison to edit my essays literally a day before the deadline and she provided the best edits anyone has given over the past couple of months of asking family members, teachers, and alumni. She was very specific on what edits needed to be made, and kindly made a video explaining why certain things needed to be removed. My favorite part about her is that she transformed my essays but still managed to keep my voice and the original essence. I recommend her to anyone. Even if you think your essays are great she will find a way to make them even better!!</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">THANK YOU SO SO MUCH, for the very specific instructions on how I can improve. Like I'm actually really surprised because whenever I give it to my friends or teachers they always just point out what makes them feel wrong. It makes me so stressed because I didn't know how to improve. BUT you really really helped in a way that didn't totally stress me out. That means a lot to me. I will definitely be coming back to you for more edits!</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">I just wanted to say your advice is so helpful!!!! I don't have a descriptive style of writing in my essays bc I think I've been treating them more analytically than personally, so your advice made me think of things from a new perspective!! Also, I'm a journalist (editor in chief of student newspaper) and I think I just wrote off auto-pilot since we are told to make our stories concise and straightforward so thank you a ton!!! nobody else who read my work really pointed it out and I'm seeing a new way in how to my supplementals better now!</p>

            <p class="testimonial-text">Maddie was a lifesaver for my UC essays: she completely transformed them! I consider myself to be a strong writer and was rather confident about my PIQs, but they seemed lifeless without her insightful edits. She guided me through each aspect of my essay by disclosing her analysis and opinions with a video that she personally recorded just for me! Having a college counselor already, I can very confidently say that Maddison has steered my college essays in a way that no professional has in the past few months. I thoroughly enjoyed working with her and would recommend everyone, confident with their essays or not, to get them looked over by Maddie so that she can "work her magic" and inject it within your application.</p>
